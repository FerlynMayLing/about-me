# Hello there, I'm _git:octocat:_ that you found me ! :innocent:

:thought_balloon: I am a female software developer who loves to strive for achievement by designing something creative and convenient from my fresh & sometimes weird ideas.

:art: I am sort of a design person who feels unbearable when the overall design alignments and colors are untidy and not consistent. It then burns up a strong desire to fix them right.

:paw_prints: I am also a pet lover who likes Golden.. no no, who is definitely a Golden Retrievers addict!

If you would like to know more about me, you may have a look on my [updated resume](my-resume.md) or [download a copy](https://github.com/FerlynMayLing/about-me/raw/master/my-resume.docx) for reference.
